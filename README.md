This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## GOAL

Every day, thousands of pounds perfectly good food is wasted in the restaurant industry. 

This project in its initial stages is a precursor to a hopefully  fully fledged website where people can search up local charities nearby to donate surplus food to them so that the charities can find ways to distribute this food to needy deserving people.

Plans are in the pipleline to facilitate other types of donations too.
